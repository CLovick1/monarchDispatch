			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-16b"><br><center>By: BECKY MAGNOLIA </center><br><br><p>The Monarch School District has recently announced its plan to expand scratch-cooked meal options for students, and the move has been widely welcomed by students, parents, and staff members alike. Edith Greenly, a dedicated lunch lady who has been working for the district for 25 years, has expressed her excitement about the program and the benefits it will bring to the school community.<br><br>
			Scratch cooking involves preparing meals from whole, unprocessed ingredients rather than relying on pre-packaged, processed foods. This approach to cooking has gained popularity in recent years as more people become aware of the health risks associated with processed foods and the benefits of eating fresh, whole foods.<br><br>
			According to Greenly, scratch cooking has been a passion of hers for many years. She believes that it not only tastes better but is also healthier for students. "When you cook from scratch, you know exactly what ingredients are going into the food. You can control the amount of salt, sugar, and fat that goes into the meals, which is important for the health of our students," she said.<br><br></p></div>

			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-18"><p>Greenly also pointed out that scratch cooking is a great way to introduce students to new foods and flavors. "When you cook from scratch, you have the flexibility to experiment with different spices, herbs, and seasonings. This can make the food more interesting and exciting for students and encourage them to try new things," she said.<br><br>
			The Monarch School District's decision to expand scratch-cooked meal options is a welcome move, not only for the health benefits it offers but also for the positive impact it will have on the local community.<br><br>
			Greenly is excited about the new program and is looking forward to introducing students to the joys of scratch cooking. "I think this program will be a game-changer for our students. They will have access to healthier, tastier meals, and we'll be able to teach them about the importance of eating fresh, whole foods. It's a win-win for everyone," she said.</p></div>
