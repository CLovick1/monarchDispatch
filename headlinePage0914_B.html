			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-16b"><br><center>By: DIANE ROSENBLOOM</center><br><br><p>Residents of Monarch, Wyoming, are celebrating the completion of the historic Main Street restoration project. The project, which began in 1988, aimed to preserve and restore the historic buildings along Main Street, while also improving the infrastructure and safety of the area.<br><br>
	The restoration project was a collaborative effort between the Monarch community, local government, and the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office. Together, they worked to develop a comprehensive plan to restore the buildings while preserving their historic character.<br><br>
	The project involved extensive research into the history of each building, as well as the architecture and design of the original structures. This information was used to guide the restoration process, ensuring that the buildings were restored to their original beauty and functionality. One of the key goals of the project was to improve the safety and accessibility of the Main Street area. To achieve this, the project team worked to upgrade the infrastructure, including sidewalks, streetlights, and utilities.<br><br></p></div>

The restoration project has had a significant impact on the community of Monarch. The restored buildings have brought new life and vitality to the area, attracting new businesses and visitors to the town. The improved infrastructure and safety measures have also made the area more attractive to residents, who can now enjoy the historic beauty of Main Street without worrying about safety hazards or inconveniences.<br><br>
	Mayor Lionel Wolff commented, "The completion of the Main Street restoration project is a testament to the power of community collaboration and the importance of preserving our shared heritage. It is a reminder that historic preservation is not just about restoring buildings, but also about revitalizing communities and creating a sense of pride and identity.
	The Monarch Main Street restoration project serves as an inspiration to other communities across the country to take on similar restoration projects, and to work together to preserve and celebrate our shared history. As we look to the future, we must continue to value and protect the places that define our communities, ensuring that they remain vibrant and meaningful for generations to come."</p></div>
