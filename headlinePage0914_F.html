			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-16b"><br><center>By Thomas L. Friedman NYT (ChatGPT)</center><br><br><p>In a significant development aimed at resolving the Afghan civil war and promoting free elections, the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to halt arms sales to combatants in Afghanistan. Soviet Foreign Minister Boris D. Pankin and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d issued a joint statement announcing their intention to cease weapons deliveries by January 1, 1992, and urged other nations to follow suit. The agreement also included a commitment not to escalate current arms shipments to their respective Afghan allies. Additionally, during his visit to the Soviet Union, Baker discussed the possibility of reducing short-range nuclear weapons with General Vladimir Lobov, Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet armed forces.<br><br>
			This agreement signifies a major step in ending the long-standing conflicts between the superpowers. The resolution of regional disputes such as the recognition of the Baltic states' independence, the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Cuba, and the exploration of a settlement regarding the Kurile islands dispute with Japan has paved the way for improved Soviet-American relations. The Soviet Union's willingness to compromise on these contentious issues indicates their desire for economic aid from the West. The current Soviet leadership, following the August revolution that saw the removal of hard-liners and the dissolution of the Communist Party, seeks to swiftly exploit the opportunity for assistance before the future of the central government under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev becomes uncertain.<br><br></p></div>

			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-18"><p>While the agreement to stop arms sales does not completely resolve the Afghan civil war, it does disengage the superpowers from the conflict, potentially facilitating a peaceful resolution. The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, and despite their subsequent withdrawal, they continued to support the Afghan government. The negotiations for a simultaneous arms cutoff and the establishment of a transitional government for free elections have been hindered by President Najibullah's refusal to step aside early in the process. It remains uncertain whether the rebels, Mr. Najibullah, and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan will fully cooperate in implementing the arms cutoff.<br><br>
			In addition to the Afghan agreement, Baker and Pankin discussed the proposed Middle East peace conference, although the timing and wording of invitations have not been finalized. The participation of Palestinians and Israel's request for housing loan guarantees are among the unresolved issues. The United States aims to postpone the loan guarantee request until after the conference and insists on a freeze on new Israeli settlements in return.<br><br>
			During his visit, Baker also visited K.G.B. headquarters, where he was informed by the new K.G.B. chief, Vadim V. Bakatin, of the Soviet Union's desire to reduce spying activities between the two countries. The meeting symbolized the changing nature of Soviet-American relations and the ongoing transformations within the Soviet Union.<br><br>
			Overall, these developments mark significant progress in resolving regional conflicts and improving Soviet-American relations. The agreements on arms sales cessation in Afghanistan and the willingness to reduce spying activities represent important steps towards peace and cooperation between the superpowers.</p></div>
