			<div class = "grid-item grid-item-16b"><center><br>By: DIANE ROSENBLOOM</center><br><center><h4>Listen to this article!</h4><!-- Audio player --><audio controls><source src="audio/newsStories/914KKKK.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></center><br><p>A late summer breeze swept through the Monarch Mustangs High School stadium, setting the stage for the highly anticipated homecoming game against the Rock Springs Tigers. Excitement filled the air as the crowd donned the school's colors of blue and gold, eagerly awaiting the clash between these long-standing rivals.
Among the Mustangs' roster was Bryan Gollen, a linebacker known for his brawn rather than his brains. Despite being a third-year freshman, Bryan's enthusiasm for the game was unmatched. As he charged onto the field, his eyes gleamed with a mix of determination and occasional confusion.<br><br>
The game kicked off with both teams displaying their skills and strategies. The Tigers took an early lead, exploiting gaps in the Mustangs' defense to score a touchdown. But Bryan and the rest of the defense were undeterred, charging forward with a blend of brute force and instinct. Bryan's approach to the game was simple: hit anything that moved, regardless of the consequences.<br><br>
As the game progressed, the Mustangs relied on their tradition of physicality and brute strength to hold the Tigers at bay. Bryan threw himself at opponents, often forgetting to read the play or cover his assigned zone. He would charge recklessly into the fray, hoping to make a big hit and inspire his teammates. <br><br></p></div>

The stadium buzzed with anticipation as the offense took the field, hoping for a last-minute touchdown to seal the victory. Bryan, still catching his breath from a questionable tackle attempt, stood on the sideline, oblivious to the complexities of the game plan.<br><br>
In a surprising turn of events, the offense marched down the field, guided by the skilled plays of their quarterback, Russ Dakota. The crowd erupted with cheers as the Mustangs neared the end zone. With seconds remaining on the clock, the quarterback tossed a high pass towards Tim Axel, the son of coach Brandon Axel, who had inexplicably found himself wide open. Astonished, Tim managed to catch the ball, his hands fumbling the leather like a hot potato.<br><br>
Realizing that the end zone lay just yards away, Tim rumbled forward, leaving a trail of defenders in his wake. In a moment of sheer luck, he managed to crash through the defensive line, falling into the end zone for a touchdown. The crowd, a mixture of disbelief and amusement, erupted in applause.
As the final whistle blew, the Mustangs celebrated their improbable victory. <br><br>
After the game Bryan Gollen said, "It was a beautiful night, so many guys stepped up and played their hearts out. This was definitely a team victory."
When asked about their chances at winning the Wyoming state championship, Bryan said, "Yeah, we have a great shot at winning the whole thing this year."</p></div>
